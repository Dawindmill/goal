## Init Phase
It is a simple workflow. Start with PM Board to create To Do Note about idea, task, etc. Perform some research, reading and experiment. If an idea is viable, convert it into issue (right click on Note -> convert). And track the issue until it get implemented. Then it goes to Wiki for documenting about it such as operation manual, knowledge base, how to, so on.

## Operation Phase
* Deploy
* Document at Wiki
* If issue arise, create issue ticket. Optionally bring it into PM Board (top right > click Add cards > add issue to To Do or In Progress)
* Fix
* Close issue with comments
* Go to step 1
